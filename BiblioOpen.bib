	abstract = {Envirotyping is an essential technique used to unfold the nongenetic drivers associated with the phenotypic adaptation of living organisms. Here, we introduce the EnvRtype R package, a novel toolkit developed to interplay large-scale envirotyping data (enviromics) into quantitative genomics. To start a user-friendly envirotyping pipeline, this package offers: (1) remote sensing tools for collecting (get\_weather and extract\_GIS functions) and processing ecophysiological variables (processWTH function) from raw environmental data at single locations or worldwide; (2) environmental characterization by typing environments and proﬁling descriptors of environmental quality (env\_typing function), in addition to gathering environmental covariables as quantitative descriptors for predictive purposes (W\_matrix function); and (3) identiﬁcation of environmental similarity that can be used as an enviromic-based kernel (env\_typing function) in whole-genome prediction (GP), aimed at increasing ecophysiological knowledge in genomic best-unbiased predictions (GBLUP) and emulating reaction norm effects (get\_kernel and kernel\_model functions). We highlight literature mining concepts in ﬁne-tuning envirotyping parameters for each plant species and target growing environments. We show that envirotyping for predictive breeding collects raw data and processes it in an eco-physiologically smart way. Examples of its use for creating global-scale envirotyping networks and integrating reaction-norm modeling in GP are also outlined. We conclude that EnvRtype provides a cost-effective envirotyping pipeline capable of providing high quality enviromic data for a diverse set of genomic-based studies, especially for increasing accuracy in GP across untested growing environments.},

	abstract = {Under global climate changes, understanding climate variables that are most associated with environmental kinships can contribute to improving the success of hybrid selection, mainly in environments with high climate variations. The main goal of this study is to integrate envirotyping techniques and multi-trait selection for mean performance and the stability of maize genotypes growing in the Huanghuaihai plain in China. A panel of 26 maize hybrids growing in 10 locations in two crop seasons was evaluated for 9 traits. Considering 20 years of climate information and 19 environmental covariables, we identified four mega-environments (ME) in the Huanghuaihai plain which grouped locations that share similar long-term weather patterns. All the studied traits were significantly affected by the genotype × mega-environment × year interaction, suggesting that evaluating maize stability using single-year, multi-environment trials may provide misleading recommendations. Counterintuitively, the highest yields were not observed in the locations with higher accumulated rainfall, leading to the hypothesis that lower vapor pressure deficit, minimum temperatures, and high relative humidity are climate variables that –under no water restriction– reduce plant transpiration and consequently the yield. Utilizing the multi-trait mean performance and stability index (MTMPS) prominent hybrids with satisfactory mean performance and stability across cultivation years were identified. G23 and G25 were selected within three out of the four mega-environments, being considered the most stable and widely adapted hybrids from the panel. The G5 showed satisfactory yield and stability across contrasting years in the drier, warmer, and with higher vapor pressure deficit mega-environment, which included locations in the Hubei province. Overall, this study opens the door to a more systematic and dynamic characterization of the environment to better understand the genotype-by-environment interaction in multi-environment trials.},

	abstract = {Key message: We propose an enviromics prediction model for cultivar recommendation based on thematic maps for decision-makers.
Parsimonious methods that capture genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) in multi-environment trials (MET) are important in breeding programs. Understanding the causes and factors of GEI allows the utilization of genotype adaptations in the target population of environments through environmental features and Factor-Analytic (FA) models. Here, we present a novel predictive breeding approach called GIS-FA that integrates geographic information systems (GIS) techniques, FA models, Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, and Enviromics to predict phenotypic performance in untested environments. The GIS-FA approach allows: (i) predict the phenotypic performance of tested genotypes in untested environments; (ii) select the best-ranking genotypes based on their over-all performance and stability using the FA selection tools; (iii) draw thematic maps showing overall or pairwise performance and stability for decision-making. We exemplify the usage of GIS-FA approach using two datasets of rice [Oryza sativa (L.)] and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in MET spread over tropical areas. In summary, our novel predictive method allows the identification of new breeding scenarios by pinpointing groups of environments where genotypes have superior predicted performance and facilitates/optimizes the cultivar recommendation by utilizing thematic maps.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic datasets in plant breeding are commonly incomplete due to missing phenotypic information. The best approach for correcting these datasets for a stage-wise genomic prediction (GP) is not unanimous in the scientific community. Therefore, this study evaluates a two-step GP based on different methods of phenotypic correction considering complete and incomplete datasets of maize (Zea mays L.) single crosses. The dataset consists of 325 hybrids evaluated for grain yield and plant height in four sites. Sequential levels of data loss were simulated to the original dataset (from 0 to 30\%) to assess the impact of missing information. The prediction was performed by an additive genomic best linear unbiased prediction model (GBLUP) using best linear unbiased estimations (BLUEs), best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs), and deregressed BLUPs as the response variable. Mean reliability and predictive ability slightly decreased as missing phenotypic information increased, irrespective of the response variable. Regarding phenotypic correction, all methods yielded similar results for these parameters over most missing information percentages. The coincidence of selection between single- and two-stage GP was not systematically affected by response variable across multiple selection intensities, and missing data only led to a minor decrease in coincidence. Therefore, from a breeding standpoint, regardless of phenotypic correction method and missing data level, a similar set of genotypes tend to be selected.},

	abstract = {Modern whole-genome prediction (WGP) frameworks that focus on multi-environment trials (MET) integrate large-scale genomics, phenomics, and envirotyping data. However, the more complex the statistical model, the longer the computational processing times, which do not always result in accuracy gains. We investigated the use of new kernel methods and modeling structures involving genomics and nongenomic sources of variation in two MET maize data sets. Five WGP models were considered, advancing in complexity from a main-effect additive model (A) to more complex structures, including dominance deviations (D), genotype × environment interaction (AE and DE), and the reaction-norm model using environmental covariables (W) and their interaction with A and D (AW + DW). A combination of those models built with three different kernel methods, Gaussian kernel (GK), Deep kernel (DK), and the benchmark genomic best linear-unbiased predictor (GBLUP/GB), was tested under three prediction scenarios: newly developed hybrids (CV1), sparse MET conditions (CV2), and new environments (CV0). GK and DK outperformed GB in prediction accuracy and reduction of computation time ({\textasciitilde}up to 20\%) under all model–kernel scenarios. GK was more efficient in capturing the variation due to A + AE and D + DE effects and translated it into accuracy gains ({\textasciitilde}up to 85\% compared with GB). DK provided more consistent predictions, even for more complex structures such as W + AW + DW. Our results suggest that DK and GK are more efficient in translating model complexity into accuracy, and more suitable for including dominance and reaction-norm effects in a biologically accurate and faster way.},

	abstract = {Establishing the connection between genotype and phenotype is currently one of the most significant challenges facing modern plant biology. Although spectacular advances in next-generation DNA sequencing have allowed genomic data to become commonplace throughout biology, progress has been much slower in translating this discrete DNA base pair information into an accurate description of phenotypic variation. The limiting factor for quantifying phenotypes, particularly in the context of agricultural and native plant populations, has been the lack of phenotypic information of a scale, density, and accuracy comparable to DNA sequencing data. The extensive collection of phenotypic data for many physiological and developmental traits from many individuals remains onerous (Furbank and Tester, 2011). As a result, for large populations, there is often a focus on traits that are easy or inexpensive to measure, while more costly or difficult-to-score phenotypes are studied in only a few individuals. This is especially true for traits that are complex in nature, meaning that they have polygenic inheritance and varying responses to the environment. Complex traits are of primary interest not only because they represent the majority of important agronomic crop traits but also because they govern key biological processes that influence overall plant productivity and adaptability in plant populations (Lynch and Walsh, 1998). Success in deciphering these processes could translate into increased genetic gains in plant breeding, elucidation of the mechanisms impacting important ecophysiological traits, and improved crop management decisions to further maximize yield and quality. In light of these potential benefits, the aim of this Update article is to present the basic principles of phenomics, summarize the current state of field-based phenotyping, and highlight key challenges and limitations. In addition, the areas of data collection and management, environmental characterization, and crop growth models (CGMs) are presented as topics where further consideration is needed to capitalize on advancements in phenotyping technologies.},
